             Political law is defined as the branch of public law which deals with the organization and operation of the governmental organs of the State and defines the relations of the state with the inhabitants of its territory. (Macariola v. Asuncion, A.M. No. 133-J, May 31, 1982) 
            """,
            """<b>The Constitution</b>
             It is a written and codified document which serves as the fundamental law of the state. A written instrument enacted by direct action of the people by which the fundamental powers of the government are established, limited, and defined, and by which those powers are distributed among the several departments for their safe and useful exercise for the benefit of the people. (Manila Prince Hotel v. GSIS, G.R. No. 122156, February 3, 1997) 
             
             The constitution is the work or will of the people themselves, in their original, sovereign, and unlimited capacity. Law is the work or will of the legislature in its derivative and subordinate capacity. The one is the work of the creator, and the other of the creature. The constitution fixes limits to the exercise of legislative authority and prescribes the orbit within which it must move. In short, gentlemen, the constitution is the sun of the political system, around which all Legislative, Executive, and Judicial bodies must revolve. Whatever may be the case in other countries, yet in this, there can be no doubt, that every act of the legislature, repugnant to the Constitution, is absolutely void. (Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 308, April 1, 1795)

            """<b>The Importance of the Constitution</b>
            The role of the constitution cannot be overlooked. It is through the constitution that the fundamental powers of government are established, limited, and defined, and by which these powers are distributed among the several departments. The constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must conform and to which all persons, including the highest officials of the land, must defer. Constitutional doctrines must remain steadfast no matter what may be the tides of time. It cannot be simply made to sway and accommodate the call of situations and much more tailor itself to the whims and caprices of government and the people who run it. (Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission, G.R. No. 192935, December 7, 2010)
             
            The constitution, as the fundamental law of the land, deserves the utmost respect and obedience of all the citizens of this nation. No one can trivialize the constitution by cavalierly amending or revising it in blatant violation of the clearly specified modes of amendment and revision laid down in the constitution itself.

            """<b>A Constitution Is a System of Fundamental Laws</b>
             A constitution is a system of fundamental laws for the governance and administration of a nation. It is supreme, imperious, absolute, and unalterable except by the authority from which it emanates. It has been defined as the fundamental and paramount law of the nation. It prescribes the permanent framework of a system of government, assigns to the different departments their respective powers and duties, and establishes certain fixed principles on which government is founded. The fundamental conception in other words is that it is a supreme law to which all other laws must conform and in accordance with which all private rights must be determined and all public authority administered.

            """<b>Types of Constitution</b>
             There are several types of constitution: 
             1. <b>Written constitution</b> is a kind of a constitution whose provisions are all contained in a single document. A good example of this constitution is the Philippine Constitution.
             2. <b>Unwritten constitution</b> is a kind of constitution where the provisions are not contained in a single document but rather in different documents which are considered as part of the fundamental law of the land. A more appropriate term for this kind would be un- compiled constitution. The constitution of United Kingdom is a fine example of this type of constitution.
             3. <b>Conventional or enacted constitution</b> is a type of constitution that was formulated by a constitutional convention that is called to draft the constitution.
             4. <b>Cumulative or evolved constitution</b> is a constitution which is not drafted by a positive act of the state, but it developed as a part of the history of the nation.
             5. <b>Rigid or inelastic constitution</b> is one which cannot be easily amended unless such amendment is provided for by the constitution itself.
             6. <b>Flexible or elastic constitution</b> is one which can easily be changed anytime.

            """<b>Parts of the Constitution</b>
            The constitution as a fundamental law has three major parts namely: 
            1. <b>Constitution of Government</b>  which refers to those provisions which set up the governmental structure specifically, Articles VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X of the 1987 Constitution,
            2. <b>Constitution of Liberty</b>  are the provisions which guarantee individual fundamental liberties against governmental abuse specifically provided in Articles III, IV, V, XII, XIII, XIV, and XV of the 1987 Constitution, and
            3. <b>Constitution of Sovereignty</b>  which refers to those provisions which outline the process whereby the sovereign people may change the constitution. These are provided in Article XVII and Article II, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution.
            """,
            """<b> Qualities of a Written Constitution</b>
             A desirable written constitution must be broad, brief, and definite.
            
            It must be broad in the sense that it provides for the organization and structure of the entire government. It must embody the political history of the nation, the present realities and the future prospects of the nation's destiny. The constitution must be brief for it must limit itself to the basic principles and leave the implementations of such fundamental principles to the sound judgment of the legislative department. It must be definite in order to avoid unnecessary ambiguities which would later on lead to confusion, brought about by the different interpretations and constructions of its provisions. (Cruz, 2003)

             Under the doctrine of Constitutional Supremacy, if a law or contract violates any norm of the constitution, that law or contract whether promulgated by the legislative or by the executive branch or entered into by private persons for private purposes is null and void and without any force and effect. Thus, since the constitution is the fundamental, paramount and supreme law of the nation, it is deemed written in every statute and contract. (Manila Prince Hotel v.

             In case of doubt, the constitution should be considered self- executing rather than non-self-executing.

            Based on the decrees of June 18 and 23, 1898, Aguinaldo convened the Revolutionary Congress at Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan. The delegates were elected by the people but in areas which were still under the Spanish control, Aguinaldo appointed their delegates to Congress. The members composing the Congress included 43 lawyers, 18 doctors, five pharmacists, seven businessmen, four agriculturists, three educators, three soldiers, two engineers, two painters, and one priest. (Constantino, 1975)
            
             The Malolos Constitution is the first important Filipino document produced by the people's representatives although not all the members who drafted and approved the Constitution were elected by the people. The Constitution was anchored on democratic traditions although it was based and patterned on the constitutions of other countries. The Malolos Constitution created a state whose government was republican in character - popular and representative democracy composed of three distinct branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The Constitution specifically provided for safeguards against abuses and enumerated the national and individual rights not only of the Filipinos and of the aliens in the country as well. 
             
             The legislative powers were exercised by the Assembly of Representatives composed of delegates elected according to law. To make the function of Congress continuous, the document provided for a Permanent Commission which would sit as a law-making body when Congress was not in session - a result of the insecurities of the illustrado members of congress that the president might abuse his powers while the assembly is not in session. The assembly elected the President of the Republic. The Cabinet, composed of the Secretaries of the different Departments of the government, was responsible not to the President, but to the Assembly. The administration of justice was vested in the Supreme Court and in inferior courts to be established according to law. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was to be elected by the Assembly with the concurrence of the President and the Cabinet. (Agoncillo, 1990)

            Based on the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Law, a constitution must be drafted by a Constitutional Convention and ratified by the Filipino people prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Government. On July 10, 1934, the Filipinos elected 202 delegates to the Constitutional Convention. On July 30, 1934, the Convention was formally inaugurated with Claro M. Recto as president.
            
             The draft of the Constitution was approved with amendments on January 31, 1935. It was written in English and in Spanish. On February 8, 1935, the Convention approved the Constitution by a vote of 177 in favor and one against. The lone delegate who voted against the approval of the Constitution was Tomas Cabili of Lanao.
             
              The Constitution was brought to Washington by Quezon, Recto, and Roxas for the approval of the President of the United States in accordance with the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Law. President Franklin Roosevelt approved the Charter on March 23, 1935. The Constitution was submitted to the Filipino people for ratification on a plebiscite held on May 14, 1935. The Filipinos approved the Constitution by a vote of 1,213,046 and only 44,963 voted against the Constitution.
              
               For the first time in Philippine history, the women voted in the plebiscite to ratify the 1935 Constitution. The 1935 Constitution provided that women suffrage or the right to vote would be granted if no less than 300,000 qualified women were to vote affirmatively for the grant of the right of suffrage within two years after the adoption of the Constitution. It divided the government into three co-equal branches namely the legislative, executive, and judicial. The executive power was vested on the President of the Philippines who would be elected directly by the people to serve for a term of four years and can be reelected for another four-year term. The legislative power was vested in the Congress of the Philippines composed of the Senate with twenty-four senators elected at large for a term of six years and the House of Representatives composed of not more than 120 members representing the different provinces of the country with a term of four years.

             On January 23, 1942, General Masaharu Homma, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Imperial Army in the Central Philippines renamed the national government as Administrative Organization. He also issued an order to Jorge Vargas, who was then an acting mayor of Manila and appointed him Chairman of the newly created Executive Commission. All the Commissioners reported directly to the Chairman of the Executive Commission. Then on January 29, 1942, the Council of the State was created as an advisory body to the Chairman of the Executive Commission. The Japanese military authorities saw the difficulty of gaining the trust and cooperation of the people with the present setup of the national government. As such, they deemed it necessary to grant Philippine independence soon as part of their propaganda efforts in gaining Filipino support and cooperation.
             
             On June 18, 1943, the KALIBAPI was tasked to form the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence. Two days later, the Commission was organized with Jose Laurel as president and Benigno Aquino and Ramon Avancena as vice presidents. The Commission drafted a Constitution which was ratified on September 4, 1943 according to the rules set by the Japanese military authorities.
              
               The Constitution provided for Assembly. On September 20, 1943, delegates to the legislature were elected. On September 25, 1943, the Legislature elected Jose Laurel as President of the Republic of the Philippines that will soon be established as provided by the Constitution. On October 14, 1943, the second Philippine Republic which is known in history as the puppet republic was inaugurated, and Jose P. Laurel was sworn to power as president. 
		  
		  However, this Constitution was short-lived owing to the fact that it was only made effective following the dictates of the Japanese invaders. Thus, after the liberation of the Philippines and the restoration of the Commonwealth government, the 1943 Constitution became a mere scrap of paper in the eyes of the Filipinos.

		     After the declaration of martial law, Marcos reconvened the 1971 Constitutional Convention to continue their task of framing a new charter. On November 29, 1972, the final draft was finished and was presented to Marcos on December 1, 1972. Marcos scheduled a plebiscite to ratify the Constitution on January 15 to 17, 1973.
		     
		     Marcos and his cohorts convened the barangay assemblies and called the voters in every barangay including the youth. The people in the assembly supposedly voted to ratify the Constitution which was a handiwork of Marcos. Based on the record released by Malacañang, 95 percent of those present approved the new charter. On this basis, Marcos signed the Constitution and declared its ratification on January 17, 1973. 
		      
		     The legal luminaries of the country opposed to Marcos assailed the validity of the 1973 Constitution especially the manner it was ratified. However, the Supreme Court which at that time beholden to Marcos, instead of upholding the majesty of the law and equity ruled on January 22, 1973 that the question of legality was moot and academic. This controversial decision of the highest tribunal led to the resignation of Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion.
		      
		     The 1973 Constitution established a parliamentary form of government with the prime minister as the chief executive. The legislative power was vested in the unicameral national assembly. The right of suffrage was made compulsory to all qualified voters. The Constitution also abolished the parity rights provisions of the 1935 Constitution, thus allowing only the Filipino citizens to own real property and exploit the natural resources of the country.
            
             The 1973 charter had undergone several amendments to suit the desires and whims of the Marcos government. In 1976, an amendment was made which created the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP) with more than 120 members including Marcos. Marcos was also empowered to appoint sectoral representatives and his cabinet members to the Batasang Pambansa. Marcos assumed the powers of both the president and the prime minister. Another amendment, known as the sixth amendment, empowered Marcos to make laws in cases of grave national emergency and these laws shall form part of the laws of the land.
             
             These amendments were submitted to the people in a plebiscite on October 16-17, 1976. As expected, more than 90 percent of the people ratified the amendments based on the data released by Malacañang and as reported by the Marcos controlled media.
              
             On January 30, 1980, another plebiscite was conducted to ratify the amendment which extended the retirement age of the justices of the Supreme Court from 65 to 70 years old, purportedly to bar the liberal and progressive justices from becoming Chief Justices.

            The State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a definite territory; (c) a government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other states. (Article I, 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of the State)
          
		   <b> Doctrine of "Acts of State" </b>
		   The Acts of State Doctrine provides that every state is bound to respect the independence of every other state and the courts will not sit in judgment of another government's acts done within its own territory. (Twomey, 2011) 
           
            A further restriction of any national jurisdiction consists in the principle that no state has jurisdiction over another state. This principle has been known for ages as the maxim par in parem non habet imperium (Latin which means equals do not have authority over one another). It is based upon the mutual independence of sovereigns and the fact resulting therefrom, that no state in its capacity as a subject of international law can be subject to the laws of another state. This also means that acts carried out by a state in the exercise of its sovereign powers are exempted from the jurisdiction of other states by virtue of their very nature. Thus, foreign states are exempted from municipal jurisdiction of another state. The immunity granted to foreign states in the municipal courts of foreign states extends to the representatives of the said sovereign.

            Permanent population refers to an adequate number of people that is permanently linked to a specific piece of territory. There is no required number of people that would constitute as an element of the state. There is also no requirement for the population to be indigenous and the extent of social and cultural cohesion required is also unclear. In reality, most of the population of a state will be its 'nationals' and have a right to reside in that state. The criteria of qualification for nationality are determined by national law. The size of the population is immaterial. (https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ society-politics-law/exploring-the-boundaries-international-law/ content-section-2.- accessed date: 1/15/2020)

            Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law of a state that bestows on that person the rights and privileges of membership in a political community. Such rights and privileges include the right to vote, work and live in the country and the right to return to the country, besides other rights. A citizen may also be subject to certain duties, such as the duty to serve in the army. A person may have multiple citizenships and a person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless. On the other hand, subjects are people of a monarchial state and governed by the monarch's law.

            Nationality is membership in a political community with corresponding rights and obligations. In exchange for the protection that the national gets from the state, he is required to obey its laws. This term is interchangeably used with the term citizenship. However, citizenship has a more exclusive scope and applies only to certain members of the state who are accorded more privileges than the rest of the people who owe the state their allegiance. For example, during the American colonization of the Philippines, Filipinos and Americans were considered nationals of the United States of America but Filipinos were not entitled to American citizenship rights like the right to vote for the public officers of the United States.

The size of the territory of states can vary widely from Russia with 17 million square kilometers to the principality of Monaco with just two square kilometers territory. The borders of the state's territory need to be reasonably determinate. The territory of the state sometimes is defined by a treaty or mandated by its constitution. Territorial disputes with neighboring states would not normally affect the state's status in international law.
            
             Territory is a geographical area that is owned and controlled by the state in order to exercise its sovereignty. The territory of the state must be permanent and with well-defined boundaries. There is no required size or extent of the state's territory, but it must be large enough to provide for the needs of the people of the state.

      Colt Republic Act No. 9522 is not unconstitutional. It is a Statutory Tool to Demarcate the Country's Maritime Zones and Continental Shelf under UNCLOS III, not to Delineate Philippine Territory.
      
      UNCLOS III has nothing to do with the acquisition (or loss) of territory. It is a multilateral treaty regulating, among others, sea-use rights over maritime zones (i.e., the territorial waters [12 nautical miles from the baselines], contiguous zone [24 nautical miles from the baselines], exclusive economic zone [200 nautical miles from the baselines]), and continental shelves that UNCLOS III delimits. UNCLOS III was the culmination of decades-long negotiations among United Nations members to codify norms regulating the conduct of States in the world's oceans and submarine areas, recognizing coastal and archipelagic States' graduated  authority over a limited span of waters and submarine lands along their coasts.
      
      On the other hand, baselines laws such as Republic Act No. 9522 are enacted by UNCLOS III State parties to mark out specific base points along their coasts from which baselines are drawn, either straight or contoured, to serve as geographic starting points to measure the breadth of the maritime zones and continental shelf.
      
      Thus, baselines laws are nothing but statutory mechanisms for UNCLOS III States parties to delimit with precision the extent of their maritime zones and continental shelves. In turn, this gives notice to the rest of the international community of the scope of the maritime space and submarine areas within which State parties exercise treaty-based rights, namely, the exercise of sovereignty over territorial waters (Article 2), the jurisdiction to enforce customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitation laws in the contiguous zone (Article 33), and the right to exploit the living and non-living resources in the exclusive economic zone (Article 56) and continental shelf (Article 77).
      
      Even under petitioners' theory that the Philippine territory embraces the islands and all the waters within the rectangular area delimited in the Treaty of Paris, the baselines of the Philippines would still have to be drawn in accordance with Republic Act No. 9522 because this is the only way to draw the baselines in conformity with UNCLOS III. The baselines cannot be drawn from the boundaries or other portions of the rectangular area delineated in the Treaty of Paris, but from the "outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago."
      
      UNCLOS III and its ancillary baselines laws play no role in the acquisition, enlargement, or, as petitioners claim, diminution of territory. Under traditional international law typology, States acquire (or conversely, lose) territory through occupation, accretion, cession, and prescription, not by executing multilateral treaties on the regulations of sea-use rights or enacting statutes to comply with the treaty's terms to delimit maritime zones and continental shelves. Territorial  claims to land features are outside UNCLOS III and are instead governed by the rules on general international law.
      
      Had Congress in Republic Act No. 9522 enclosed the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal as part of the Philippine archipelago, adverse legal effects would have ensued. The Philippines would have committed a breach of two provisions of UNCLOS III. First, Article 47(3) of UNCLOS III requires that "the drawing of such baselines shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago." Second, Article 47(2) of UNCLOS III requires that "the length of the baselines shall not exceed 100 nautical miles," save for three percent (3%) of the total number of baselines which can reach up to 125 nautical miles.
      
      Although the Philippines has consistently claimed sovereignty over the KIG32 and the Scarborough Shoal for several decades, these outlying areas are located at an appreciable distance from the nearest shoreline of the Philippine archipelago, such that any straight baseline loped around them from the nearest basepoint will inevitably "depart to an appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago."

            """ The principal sponsor of Republic Act No. 9522 in the Senate, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, took pains to emphasize the foregoing during the Senate deliberations:
            
            <em>What we call the Kalayaan Island Group or what the rest of the world call the Spratlys and the Scarborough Shoal are outside our archipelagic baseline because if we put them inside our baselines we might be accused of violating the provision of international law which states: "The drawing of such baseline shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago." So sa loob ng ating baseline, dapat magkalapit ang mga islands. Dahil malayo ang Scarborough Shoal, hindi natin masasabing malapit sila sa atin although we are still allowed by international law to claim them as our own.</em>
            
            <em>This is called contested islands outside our configuration. We see that our archipelago is defined by the orange line which [we] call archipelagic baseline. Ngayon, tingnan ninyo ang maliit na circle doon sa itaas, that is Scarborough Shoal, itong malaking circle sa ibaba, that is Kalayaan Group or the Spratlys. Malayo na sila sa ating archipelago kaya kung ilihis pa natin ang dating archipelagic baselines para lamang masama itong dalawang circles, hindi na sila magkalapit at baka hindi na tatanggapin ng United Nations because of the rule that it should follow the natural configuration of the archipelago.</em>
          
            Hence, far from surrendering the Philippines' claim over the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal, Congress' decision to classify the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal as "Regimes of Islands' under the Republic of the Philippines consistent with Article 121" of UNCLOS III manifests the Philippine State's responsible observance of its pacta sunt servanda obligation under UNCLOS III. Under Article 121 of UNCLOS III, any "naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide," such as portions of the KIG, qualifies under the category of "regime of islands," whose islands generate their own applicable maritime zones.
            
            As their final argument against the validity of Republic Act No. 9522, petitioners contend that the law unconstitutionally "converts" internal waters into archipelagic waters, hence subjecting these waters to right of innocent and sea lanes passage under UNCLOS III, including overflight. Petitioners extrapolate that these passage right indubitably expose Philippine internal waters to nuclear and maritime pollution hazards, in violation of the constitution.
            
            Whether referred to as Philippine "internal waters" under Article I of the Constitution or as "archipelagic waters" under UNCLOS III (Article 49 [1]), the Philippines exercises sovereignty over the body of water lying landward of the baselines, including the air space over it and the submarine areas underneath.
            
            The fact of sovereignty, however, does not preclude the operation of municipal and international law norms subjecting the territorial sea or archipelagic waters to necessary, if not marginal, burdens in the interest of maintaining unimpeded, expeditious international navigation, consistent with the international law principle of freedom of navigation. Thus, domestically, the political branches of the Philippine government, in the competent discharge of their constitutional powers, may pass legislation designating routes within the archipelagic waters to regulate innocent and sea lanes passage. Indeed, bills drawing nautical highways for sea lanes passage are now pending in Congress.
            
            In the absence of municipal legislation, international law norms, now codified in UNCLOS III, operate to grant innocent passage rights over the territorial sea or archipelagic waters, subject to the treaty's limitations and conditions for their exercise. Significantly, the right of innocent passage is a customary international law, thus automatically incorporated in the corpus of Philippine law. No modern State can validly invoke its sovereignty to absolutely forbid innocent passage that is exercised in accordance with customary international law without risking retaliatory measures from the international community.
            
            The fact that for archipelagic States, their archipelagic waters are subject to both the right of innocent passage and sea lanes passage do not place them in lesser footing vis-à-vis continental coastal States which are subject, in their territorial sea, to the right of innocent passage and the right of transit passage through international straits. The imposition of these passage rights through archipelagic waters under UNCLOS III was a concession by archipelagic States, in exchange for their right to claim all the waters landward of their baselines, regardless of their depth or distance from the coast, as archipelagic waters subject to their territorial sovereignty. More importantly, the recognition of archipelagic States' archipelago and

Separate islands generate their own maritime zones, placing the waters between islands separated by more than 24 nautical miles beyond the States' territorial sovereignty, subjecting these waters to the rights of other States under UNCLOS III.

               Petitioners' invocation of non-executory provisions in Article II (Declaration of Principles and State Policies) must also fail. Our present state of jurisprudence considers the provisions in Article II as mere legislative guides, which, absent enabling legislation, "do not embody judicially enforceable constitutional rights x x x." Article II provisions serve as guides in formulating and interpreting implementing legislation, as well as in interpreting executory provisions of the Constitution. Although Oposa v. Factoran treated the right to a healthful and balanced ecology under Section 16 of Article II as an exception, the present petition lacks factual basis to substantiate the claimed constitutional violation. The other provisions petitioners cite, relating to the protection of marine wealth (Article XII, Section 2, paragraph 251) and subsistence fishermen (Article XIII, Section 752), are not violated by Republic Act No. 9522.

               In fact, the demarcation of the baselines enables the Philippines to delimit its exclusive economic zone, reserving solely to the Philippines the exploitation of all living and non-living resources within such zone. Such a maritime delineation binds the international community since the delineation is in strict observance of UNCLOS III. If the maritime delineation is contrary to UNCLOS III, the international community will of course reject it and will refuse to be bound by it.
 
               UNCLOS III favors States with a long coastline like the Philippines. UNCLOS III creates a sui generis maritime space the exclusive economic zone - in waters previously part of the high seas. UNCLOS III grants new rights to coastal States to exclusively exploit the resources found within this zone up to 200 nautical miles. UNCLOS III, however, preserves the traditional freedom of navigation of other States that are attached to this zone beyond the territorial sea before UNCLOS III.
 
               The enactment of UNCLOS III compliant baselines law for the Philippine archipelago and adjacent areas, as embodied in Republic Act No. 9522, allows an internationally recognized delimitation of the breadth of the Philippines' maritime zones and continental shelf.
               
               Republic Act No. 9522 is therefore a most vital step on the part of the Philippines in safeguarding its maritime zones, consistent with the Constitution and our nation interest.

            In 1947, Tomas Cloma, a Filipino adventurer and a fishing magnate, discovered several uninhabited and unoccupied groups of islands/islets in the vastness of the South China Sea. On May 11, 1956, together with 40 men, Tomas Cloma and his brother Filemon took formal possession of the islands, lying some 380 miles west of the southern end of Palawan and named it "Freedomland." Four days later, on May 15, 1956, Cloma issued and posted copies of his "Notice to the Whole World" on each of the islands as a decisive manifestation of unwavering claim over the territory.
            
            Then on May 31, 1956, Tomas Cloma declared the establishment of the Free Territory of Freedomland, 10 days after he sent his second representation to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, informing the latter that the territory claimed was named "Freedomland." On July 6, 1956, Cloma declared to the whole world his claim and the establishment of a separate government for the "Free Territory of Freedomland" with its capital on Flat Island (Patag Island). His declaration was met with violent and unfriendly reactions from several neighboring countries especially Taiwan when on September 24, 1956 it effectively garrisoned the nearby island of Itu Aba and intercepted Cloma's men and vessels found within its immediate waters.

            Unable to surmount the difficulties and pressure, he ceded his claim to the Philippines for one peso. On March 1976, President Marcos issued the Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1-76 organizing the Western Command based in Palawan in response to the heightening conflict of interest in the region and to abate any untoward incident. To further the claim of the Philippines, on June 11, 1978 President Marcos, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1596, formally annexed the Kalayaan Islands creating a distinct and separate Municipality known as "Kalayaan" under the political jurisdiction of the Province of Palawan, but under the custody of the Department of National Defense.

However, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague, Netherlands on October 29, 2015 rejected China's strongest argument against the Philippines and ruled that the tribunal has the right to hear the Philippines' case.

            """<b>Ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal</b>
            On July 12, 2016, the arbitral tribunal ruled in a decision consisting of 501 pages in favor of the Philippines against China on the following issues:
            """,    
            """<b>a) Historic Rights and the 'Nine-Dash Line'</b>
            China had historic rights to resources in the waters of the South China Sea, such rights were extinguished to the extent they were incompatible with the exclusive economic zones provided for in the Convention. There was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or their resources. The Tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the 'nine-dash line.'
            """,
            """<b>b) Status of Features</b>
            The Tribunal noted that the reefs have been heavily modified by land reclamation and construction, recalled that the Convention classifies features on their natural condition, and relied on historical materials in evaluating the features. The Tribunal found historical evidence to be more relevant and noted that the Spratly Islands were historically used by small groups of fishermen and that several Japanese fishing and guano mining enterprises were attempted. The Tribunal concluded that such transient use does not constitute inhabitation by a stable community and that all of the historical economic activities had been extractive. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that none of the Spratly Islands is capable of generating extended maritime zones.
            
            The Tribunal also held that the Spratly Islands cannot generate maritime zones collectively as a unit. Having found that none of the features claimed by China was capable of generating an exclusive economic zone, the Tribunal found that it could-without delimiting a boundary-declare that certain sea areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines because those areas are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China.

            """<b>c) Lawfulness of Chinese Actions</b>      
            Having found that certain areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, the Tribunal found that China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by (a) interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum exploration, (b) constructing artificial islands, and (c) failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the zone. The Tribunal also held that fishermen from the Philippines (like those from China) had traditional fishing rights at Scarborough Shoal and that China had interfered with these rights in restricting access. The Tribunal further held that Chinese law enforcement vessels had unlawfully created a serious risk of collision when they physically obstructed Philippine vessels.
            """,
            """<b>d) Harm to Marine Environment</b>
            The Tribunal considered the effect on the marine environment of China's recent large-scale land reclamation and construction of artificial islands and other artificial features in the Spratly Islands and found that China had caused severe harm to the coral reef environment and violated its obligation to preserve and protect fragile ecosystems and the habitat of depleted, threatened, or endangered species. The Tribunal also found that Chinese authorities were aware that Chinese fishermen have harvested endangered sea turtles, coral, and giant clams on a substantial scale

            """<b>d) Harm to Marine Environment</b>
            The Tribunal considered the effect on the marine environment of China's recent large-scale land reclamation and construction of artificial islands and other artificial features in the Spratly Islands and found that China had caused severe harm to the coral reef environment and violated its obligation to preserve and protect fragile ecosystems and the habitat of depleted, threatened, or endangered species. The Tribunal also found that Chinese authorities were aware that Chinese fishermen have harvested endangered sea turtles, coral, and giant clams on a substantial scale in the South China Sea (using methods that inflict severe damage on the coral reef environment) and had not fulfilled their obligations to stop such activities.
            """,
            """<b>e) Aggravation of Dispute</b>
            Finally, the Tribunal considered whether China's actions since the commencement of the arbitration had aggravated the dispute between the Parties. The Tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the implications of a stand-off between Philippine marines and Chinese naval and law enforcement vessels at Second Thomas Shoal, holding that this dispute involved military activities and was therefore excluded from compulsory settlement.
            
            The Tribunal found, however, that China's recent large- scale land reclamation and construction of artificial islands were dispute incompatible with the obligations on a State during resolution proceedings, in so far as China has inflicted irreparable harm to the marine environment, built a large artificial island in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, and destroyed evidence of the natural condition of features in the South China Sea that formed part of the Parties' dispute.
